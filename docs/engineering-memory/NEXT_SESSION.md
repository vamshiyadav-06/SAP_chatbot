# Next session handover

## Staging readiness, auth refresh, and AI reliability (2026-11-05)

Owner requested fixes for deployment blockers, backend failures, closed public registration, protected staging access, AI streaming/fallback/cancellation/timeouts, secure refresh, browser/Docker/load/recovery checks, a fresh staging database, a repeatable Ubuntu process, and actual evidence in `docs/audits/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_AUDIT.md`. Do not alter the live Ubuntu server, push to GitHub, delete data/volumes, or make chargeable AI calls without separate approval.

* Registration now defaults closed in backend and build config. The local `.env` setting was changed without exposing its values. Tester accounts use `backend/scripts/create_user.py`.
* Staging controls: `.env.staging.example`, `scripts/staging/init-env.sh`, `deploy.sh`, optional `with-public-bind.sh`, `test-load.py`, `test-recovery.sh`, and `docs/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT.md`. Staging uses a separate Compose project and fresh volume, loopback bind, Basic auth on every route except `/health`, and backend preflight. E2E uses `.env.e2e.example`, `docker-compose.e2e.yml`, and a local stub provider.
* Refresh behavior: `frontend/src/services/api.ts` rotates via `/auth/refresh` with cookie credentials and deduplicates refresh; transient network/5xx failures preserve stored session state. `AuthContext` restores the cached profile on temporary startup failure.
* AI reliability changes are in `backend/app/services/llm_service.py`, `api/rag.py`, `schemas/message.py`, `services/rag_service.py`, and `services/conversation_memory_service.py`: partial-stream failures are terminal; timeouts share a request deadline; cancellation closes streams; truncation continuation, provider error classification, privacy-safe logs, and size limits have focused tests.
* Evidence so far: AI/deployment focused suite passed 71 tests; refresh-token suite passed 30; broader auth/RAG/query selection passed 110; conversation-memory suite passed 19; frontend Vitest passed 249 tests in 39 files; TypeScript/Vite production build passed; Playwright discovery listed 3 tests. Full `pytest backend/tests -q` did not complete, so no full-suite total is claimed. Fail-fast identified and fixed a backwards-clock test fixture; a later full attempt advanced through conversation-memory, and that module passed in isolation. No actual browser test ran.
* Docker Engine unavailable. Docker build, creation of the physical fresh staging DB, actual browser E2E, staging load test, and dump/restore recovery remain unverified. Do not claim these passed. Bash/WSL was unavailable, so Ubuntu shell scripts were reviewed but not executed. **Backend test isolation caveat:** setting provider keys to empty strings did not override `.env`; `Pydantic Settings` loaded configured values instead. That broad suite stopped at `test_web_search_returns_no_results_when_tavily_is_unavailable` after 500 passed / 2 skipped; aggregate logs cannot determine whether earlier tests reached configured services or whether any request was billable. Never claim that run was charge-free. Later safe non-live run used a verified disabled allowlist and sentinel keys, passed 112 tests / deselected 7, then hit a PostgreSQL fixture setup error because the local test server closed. No DB restart/recovery was attempted. Focused AI reliability tests use fake SDK clients. No live server, Git push, production DB, or volume was touched.
* The readiness audit records evidence and blockers. Follow with full backend suite output, rerun any corrected failures, `git diff --check`, inspect all relevant diffs without printing `.env`, and update the audit plus this handover with final evidence. Preserve existing worktree changes and untracked user artifacts.

## Deployment readiness and push to vamshiyadav-06/SAP_chatbot main (2026-11-04)

The project now deploys with `docker compose up -d --build` on a Linux server using `docker-compose.prod.yml` (postgres + backend + Caddy web front door with automatic HTTPS). Guide: `DEPLOYMENT.md`; server template `.env.production.example`; development template `.env.example` (restructured, same keys); optional `frontend/.env.example`. The frontend now calls the same-origin `/api` (KNOWN_ISSUES FE-001 resolved), and production refuses `change-me` database/admin passwords. Details and verification in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry).

Git: the pending work of the sessions below was committed as `1b43069` (single-parent; the unfinished merge of Clyptus-Soft main was closed with `git merge --quit` so commit `685bb31`, which holds Groq/Gemini/OpenRouter keys in `.env.example`, is not linked into the public repository). Deployment work: `e1ccb1f`. `target/main` (`96f4a3c`) merged with `-s ours` as `2ed880a` (tree identical to `e1ccb1f`): its only content (`f00374f`) is a strict subset of `security-remediation-20261028` (`0f44c57`), already an ancestor. **Pushed** `96f4a3c..2ed880a` to `main` of vamshiyadav-06/SAP_chatbot (fast-forward, no force; push protection did not object); this handover note is a docs-only follow-up commit on top. Not pushed to `origin` (Clyptus-Soft), and the local branch is still `updated_the_token_system` (its `target` copy was not updated). `AUDIT_REPORT.md` stays untracked: **vamshiyadav-06/SAP_chatbot is public** (GitHub API answers unauthenticated), so do not commit it.

Blockers and owner actions:
* DEPLOY-001: the backend and web images were not built here (C: about 4 GB free, Docker Desktop's disk is on C:). Build them on the server and walk through DEPLOYMENT.md once.
* The repository is public and contains the knowledge-base PDFs (licensing still open, HUMAN_ACTIONS.md §3) and the evaluation results; decide whether it should be private.
* Revoke/rotate the provider keys that were committed in `685bb31` (Clyptus-Soft history), if not done yet.
* An unrelated backend is listening on 127.0.0.1:8000 on this machine (started in an earlier session); it was left running.

Development now goes through the Vite `/api` proxy instead of calling port 8000 directly; checked with curl against a smoke backend: API 401 and SSE first event at 1.4 s, ping 12 s later (not buffered). Not verified: image builds, Let's Encrypt issuance, container write access to `knowledge_base`, a full server deployment, and a real browser session through either proxy.

## One-click organisation sharing (2026-11-04)

Organisation users share an answer to the Knowledge Hub with the "Org" button after Regenerate, or from the Share dialog ("Share to Knowledge Hub"); a like is no longer needed (server rule removed). Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry) and `docs/ORGANISATION_PORTAL.md` ("One-click share"). Not checked in the running app: clicking Org (spinner, then Shared + hub link), sharing from the dialog while the Org button updates, and the 409 already-shared path. Unstaged, not committed.

## Answer header alignment (2026-11-04)

The "Regeneration #n" badge is now a one-line pill like the other answer-header badges, the "Saved" badge stays level with "Clyptus.AI" when the badges wrap, and the admin Grounding badge is back to badge size. Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry). Verified with tests and static screenshots, not in the running app. The admin "Sources (n)" button is still oversized by the global `button{font:inherit}` rule (KNOWN_ISSUES UI-001, owner decision).

## Projects on the server; answers keep generating until Stop (2026-11-04)

Chats started from a project page are saved in that project (new `projects` table, `chats.project_id`, migration `0009_projects`; browser-saved projects are copied to the server on first load). Answers no longer stop when the user switches Sprint/Scholar, opens another chat, starts a new chat, changes page or hides the tab; the backend finishes and saves them even if the browser disconnects, and only Stop cancels. Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry); limits in KNOWN_ISSUES STREAM-001 and PROJ-001. Unstaged, not committed.

Before using: restart the backend; with `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` it applies `0007`, `0008` and `0009` to the real database (all additive). Not verified in a browser: leaving a chat mid-answer and coming back ("Still generating" then the answer), Stop on a background answer, the hidden-tab reveal, the project page list, and the one-time project copy with real browser data.

## Organisation menu and admin-set member passwords (2026-11-04)

Organisation members get **Knowledge Hub** in the sidebar and profile menu; owners/admins also get **Admin Dashboard**. Org admins now type each member's starting password (and reset passwords); members still choose their own at first sign-in. API change: `POST /org/admin/members` requires `password`, reset takes `{password}`; neither returns it. Details and verification in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry). Unstaged, not committed. Not verified in a browser (needs the backend running; see DB-002 about `AUTO_MIGRATE` applying `0007`/`0008`).

## RAG quality Phase 0+1 (2026-11-04): code in place, measurement stopped by the owner

* Code (unstaged): `llm_service.py` last-resort model pool (`LLM_LAST_RESORT_MODELS`, default `allam-2-7b,liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free`, used only after every other model failed), Groq truncation continuation / keep complete paragraphs, learned Groq TPM limit from 413 errors, Scholar history capped (6 recent messages verbatim, older as excerpts), question restated before TASK, bounded repair evidence; `config.py` `GROQ_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE` default 8000. Evaluation tool: `backend/evaluation/quality_eval.py`, `quality_judge.py`, `datasets/quality_eval_v1.jsonl` (25 cases + 5 conversations, 36 turns). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-04-rag-quality-phase0-1-design.md`.
* Tests: `test_rag_quality_phase1.py` 14 passed, `test_quality_eval.py` 21 passed (offline).
* Measurement: the owner stopped both runs. Partial files in `backend/evaluation/results/`: `quality_base2-judged.jsonl` (30/36 judged), `quality_phase1.jsonl` (22/36 generated, not judged). No before/after comparison exists, so no quality improvement is claimed. The CLI never overwrites a label: resume under new labels (`--label phase1b --no-judge`, then `--label phase1b-judged --rejudge phase1b --judge groq`).
* Owner actions: set `.env` `GROQ_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE=8000` (it is 9000; the real free-tier limit measured from Groq headers is 8000). Gemini's daily quota was exhausted during the runs.
* Not started (need approval): follow-up handling (Phase 3), retrieval/evidence (Phase 2), identifier checks (Phase 4); the 44 excluded `self_authored` documents to review with the owner.

## Token savings: stored and shown (2026-11-04)

Built design B: per-answer `tokens_used`/`tokens_baseline` (migration `0008`), `token_usage` in chat history, `GET /api/auth/me/token-savings`, a "saved in this chat" line and a Settings card. Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. Unstaged, not committed.

Pending owner review: the answer-cache spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-04-answer-cache-design.md` (not committed: committing now would also commit the in-progress merge). After approval: writing-plans, then implementation (migration `0009`).

Note: the next backend start with `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` applies both `0007` (merge) and `0008` to the real database; both are additive.

## Sign-in page clean-up (2026-11-04)

Back links removed from `/login` and the organisation sign-in pages, dot background removed, organisation password hint moved under the password field. See `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. Unstaged.

## Organisation sign-in fix and redesign (2026-11-04)

Opening `/organisation/login` while signed in as an individual no longer jumps to `/app`; organisation pages' nav points to the organisation sign-in; organisation members log out to the organisation sign-in; the organisation auth pages have their own artwork and copy. Details and verification in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry). Unstaged, nothing committed. Not verified: dark mode, a real phone, and a real organisation sign-in against the backend (needs the backend running; see the DB-002 note about `AUTO_MIGRATE`).

## Landing page tweak (2026-11-04)

Removed the `01` next to "WHAT IS CLYPTUS.AI" on the landing page; see `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. Vitest 24 files / 152 passed; not checked in a browser. Unstaged, like the entries below.

## Open individual sign-up (2026-11-04)

Owner decision: normal users create their own account (no code, 8+ character password); after creating it they are sent to the Sign In tab ("Account created. Please sign in.", e-mail kept) and must log in, because `/api/auth/register` no longer returns a session. Organisations keep the Super-Admin activation-code system. Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry). All edits are unstaged working-tree changes on top of the still-uncommitted merge (MERGE_HEAD set, staged index untouched). Nothing committed or pushed.

Verification completed (after the no-auto-login follow-up): 10 backend files, 109 passed (the 7 below plus `test_edit_prompt`, `test_share_prompt`, `test_regeneration`, `-m "not live"`); Vitest 23 files / 151 passed; `tsc -b` clean; no new oxlint warnings. Earlier run: 7 auth/registration/organisation test files, 92 passed (`test_audit_access`, `test_audit_auth`, `test_auth_and_isolation`, `test_security`, `test_security_audit_characterization`, `test_org_activation`, `test_org_accounts_and_admin`; provider keys blanked, `sap_brim_ai_test`); Vitest 22 files / 148 passed; `tsc -b` clean; `vite build` passed; oxlint on changed files shows only 2 pre-existing warnings; `git diff --check` clean. Loading the real config (`.env`, `DEBUG=false`) gives `REGISTRATION_ENABLED = True`. Full backend suite not rerun.

Not verified: sign-up and the redirect to Sign In in a real browser (backend and frontend were not running; starting the backend with `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` would also apply the merge's `0007` migration to the real database, see DB-002). Restart the backend if it was started before this change. Open risks for the owner: KNOWN_ISSUES AUTH-001 (no e-mail verification, KB and LLM quota open to every sign-up).

Pending, not started: the regenerate-with-versions design (answer version switcher `< 2/3 >`, "different model" label, and the fix so a regeneration never reuses the model that wrote the previous version) was presented in chat on 2026-11-04 and is awaiting owner approval. Bugs found while designing it: regeneration #1 reuses the same provider/model when `LLM_PROVIDER=local`, or when the original answer came from a fallback provider (`llm_service._provider_order`/`_get_models` rotate by index and ignore which model actually answered).

## Merge of `main` into `updated_the_token_system` + review fixes (2026-11-03)

State: the merge of `origin/main` (`f1abb77`, PR #8: multi-LLM regeneration, user-login logging) is resolved and staged but NOT committed (MERGE_HEAD still set; finish with `git commit`). Nothing pushed. `AUDIT_REPORT.md` stays untracked. Details of every decision and bug are in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (top entry).

What changed beyond conflict resolution: main's regeneration feature crashed every Scholar and non-streaming Sprint answer (`NameError`), had no migration for its three `messages` columns (`UndefinedColumn` on every message query), counted regenerations in a per-process dict that never passed 1 on resend, recorded guessed provider/model names, exposed model names to regular users, collided with the pipeline's `regeneration_count` diagnostic (now `repair_count`) and could order a disallowed/`local` provider. All fixed; new migration `0007_message_llm_tracking`; new `backend/tests/test_regeneration.py`. `docker-compose.yml` project name reverted to `sap_brim` (main's `sap_projects` would attach a different volume on this machine).

Verification completed:
* Backend, `pytest backend/tests -m "not live"` against `sap_brim_ai_test` with the real `.env`: 618 passed, 10 failed, 2 skipped, 7 deselected. The 10 are pre-existing and unrelated (KNOWN_ISSUES TEST-003: 5 read local `.env` overrides; TEST-004: 5 stale expectations); all failed identically before the fixes. With template values as env overrides, the 10 regeneration tests plus 4 of the TEST-003 tests passed (47 passed in that subset). Baseline right after the plain merge: 55 failed, 2 errors.
* `ruff --select F821,F822,F823,F811` over `backend`: clean (was 4x F821 `regeneration_index`).
* Frontend: Vitest 147/147 (22 files), `tsc -b` clean, `oxlint` exit 0 (existing warnings), `vite build` passed.
* `git diff --check` clean.

Not verified: live LLM providers with regeneration (provider rotation against real Groq/Gemini/OpenRouter), a browser check of the Regenerate badge, and the migration on the real `sap_brim_ai` database. With `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` the dev server will apply `0007` on its next start (additive; see DB-002). Note that some non-`live` tests still call real providers through the `.env` keys (e.g. `test_conversation_memory.py::test_15`).

Environment left by this session: Docker Desktop was started and the existing `sap_assistant_postgres` container (project `sap_brim`, volume `sap_brim_pgdata`) was started with `docker start`; both are still running. No volume was created or removed. A second, separate volume `sap_projects_pgdata` exists on this machine from an earlier run under main's project name; it was not touched.

## Live token counter and savings popup (2026-11-03)

Committed on branch `updated_the_token_system` and pushed to the `target` remote (vamshiyadav-06/SAP_chatbot); not pushed to `origin` (Clyptus-Soft). `AUDIT_REPORT.md` stays untracked. The work was built on `origin/main` at `658bfc0` (includes PR #5, the admin light theme). The first push was blocked by GitHub push protection: `origin/main` commit `685bb31` (reverted by `6f63257`) put Groq, Google/Gemini and OpenRouter API keys into `.env.example`, and they remain in that history. The branch was therefore rebased onto `3a84fa5`, whose tree equals `6f63257`. PR #5's two commits and this feature were replayed as linear commits; the code is identical to what was tested. BLOCKER (owner): revoke and rotate those three keys. Removing them from Clyptus-Soft history needs a history rewrite and a force-push, which is the owner's decision. Each streamed answer shows a running token estimate on the right of its header, then the final count and the tokens saved compared with a generic-chatbot baseline, plus a popup (a joke when 0 were saved). Details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. Fourth follow-up: popup after every answer ("You saved ~N tokens!" or "No tokens saved for this question."), never a 0; Vitest 20 files / 133 passed, build passed. Third follow-up: Sprint now sends the last 6 messages verbatim and older in-window messages as 500-character excerpts (real savings from the 5th question; the popup was hidden because Sprint saved 0 before). Answer disclaimer with a Regenerate link added under the latest answer. Verification: 14 backend files 124 passed, 1 failed (`test_15_graceful_operation_empty_history`, fails on `main` too); Vitest 20 files / 131 passed; build passed. Unverified: Sprint answer quality on follow-ups that reference messages more than 6 back, and the popup and disclaimer in a real browser. Second follow-up: the UI shows only tokens saved ("Saving tokens…" while streaming, "Saved ~N tokens" plus a popup when the saving is above 0, nothing otherwise); usage counts are no longer displayed. Vitest 129 passed, build passed. Follow-up: only prompts that got a reply are counted, and the zero-saving case is shown positively without claiming a saving. A comparison against an unnamed model was declined because its figures would not be measured. Latest verification: `test_token_savings.py` plus 9 related streaming/LLM files 92 passed; Vitest 129 passed; build passed. Earlier verification: `test_token_savings.py` 12 passed (uses `sap_brim_ai_test`); 17 related backend files 160 passed, 4 failed. The 4 failures (`test_conversation_memory.py::test_15_graceful_operation_empty_history`, three `test_query_router.py` greeting/emotional tests expecting `direct_llm`) also fail with these backend changes stashed, so they predate them. Frontend: Vitest 19 files / 129 tests passed; `npm run build` (tsc + vite) passed; oxlint on changed files shows only 3 pre-existing warnings; `git diff --check` clean. Unverified: the counter and popup in a real browser and against live providers (the app was not launched). Assumptions: counts are character-based estimates, not provider-reported usage; LLM calls outside the metered stream (image vision at upload, the unused `grounded_generator_service`) are not counted; the comparator's own web passages are not added to the baseline (keeps it conservative). Token usage is not persisted, so reloaded chats show no counter. `sap_assistant_postgres` was started for the tests and stopped again afterwards.

## Light Mode first-visit default (2026-11-03)

Changed only frontend theme defaults: `frontend/index.html` no longer hardcodes `.dark` and uses white theme-color; `public/theme-init.js` defaults missing/invalid/blocked-storage preferences to light, retaining explicit dark/system preferences; `AppLayout.tsx` defaults accounts without a saved appearance to light; `SettingsPage.tsx` initially selects Light for missing/invalid preferences. Existing account-scoped preference storage and theme controls remain unchanged. No backend or `.env` changes.

Verification completed: 103 frontend tests passed across 18 files, including 14 new startup/theme-settings regression cases. TypeScript/Vite production build passed. First build exposed missing Node test types; added a test-local type reference and reran successfully. Lint exit 0 with existing warnings; `git diff --check` passed. No live browser visual check or deployment performed. No blockers; saved Dark/System choices remain honored. No commit/push.

## Five conflict resolutions after pull / stash restore (2026-11-03)

Resolved only `backend/app/services/llm_service.py`, `backend/tests/test_rag_generation_unavailable.py`, and engineering-memory `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`, `NEXT_SESSION.md`, `RAG_FAILURE_DIAGNOSIS.md`. Inspected index base/upstream/local blobs for all five and compared both service/test deltas. Preserved upstream provider-wide authentication cooldowns, moderation-only 403 behavior, removed retired default OpenRouter model, tier logging, Scholar approved-web fallback and final all-methods error. Kept local readiness/connection diagnostics, request-scoped provider failures, shorter supported repair acceptance, redacted exception logging and all local regression coverage. Canonical merged auth failure category is `auth_error`, not the obsolete local `authentication_failed`; final sync/SSE Scholar assertions use upstream `ALL_METHODS_UNAVAILABLE_RESPONSE`. Added nested-response-401 and OpenRouter moderation-category/cooldown regressions to the resolved test file.

Merged the documentation histories rather than choosing a side; RAG_FAILURE_DIAGNOSIS explicitly distinguishes the earlier local configuration/fail-closed snapshot from the newer upstream fallback/publication behavior. Historical test/live-probe statements are retained as historical, not rerun or approval for new egress. No other implementation paths were edited. The 33 already-staged non-conflict files and existing untracked work must remain untouched; stage only the five resolved paths in this task. `.env` verified byte-for-byte unchanged through a private local comparison; no values printed. No reset, commit or push.

Completed verification: `py_compile` for both resolved Python files and `compileall -q backend` passed; AST checks found no duplicate functions/classes per scope or duplicate import statements, every upstream/local service method retained, and upstream ModelCooldowns exactly preserved. Offline targeted tests, each file in a separate process: generation-unavailable 16 passed; upstream LLM/web fallback chain 19 passed; Scholar latency/cooldowns 14 passed; LLM egress controls 9 passed; local HTTP/grounding/SSE transport 9 passed (67 total). All provider/search keys explicitly blanked in child-process environment, providers/web disabled except controlled fixtures; root `.env` unchanged. Working and staged whitespace checks passed. Index integrity verified: exactly the five resolved paths newly staged, all 33 previously staged blobs/modes unchanged, and no unmerged index entries. Final `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` and `git status` are run again after recording this result. No live provider or real-corpus generation, production deployment, full backend or frontend suite run for this merge. No blockers in the verified paths.

## Document Manager bulk delete (2026-11-03)

Super admin > Knowledge base > Document Manager & Ingestion now has row checkboxes, a select-all box, and "Delete selected (N)" with a confirmation modal. Deletion loops over the existing single-document endpoint (`services/bulkDeleteDocuments.ts`); the backend was not changed. Verification: full Vitest suite passed (15 files, 81 tests, including 3 new `bulkDeleteDocuments` tests); `tsc -b --noEmit` produced no errors; eslint reported no errors on the changed files; `npm run build` succeeded; `git diff --check` passed. Unverified: the checkbox/modal flow in a real browser and real deletion against the database (no DOM test environment; the app was not launched). Select-all covers only the at most 100 documents loaded by the page. Uncommitted.

## Super admin dashboard toggles (2026-11-03)

Accounts and Knowledge base in the super admin header are now toggles that reveal their own sub-options (`AdminDashboard.tsx`). Verification: full Vitest suite passed (14 files, 78 tests); `tsc -b --noEmit` produced no errors; eslint reported no errors on the changed files; `git diff --check` passed. Unverified: toggle click behaviour in a real browser (no DOM test environment; the app was not launched). Uncommitted.

## Local project startup (2026-11-03)

Started the backend with the repository `.venv` and `uvicorn --reload` on 127.0.0.1:8000, and the frontend with `npm run dev` at http://localhost:5173; both were left running in hidden background processes. Logs are the git-ignored `backend-dev.stdout.log`, `backend-dev.stderr.log`, `frontend-dev.stdout.log`, and `frontend-dev.stderr.log` in the repository root. Windows sandbox restrictions required elevated execution for Docker access and the servers' subprocesses. The failed initial backend process tree was terminated.

`docker compose up -d postgres` encountered a container-name conflict. The existing `sap_assistant_postgres` was already running (pgvector:pg16, host port 5435, volume `sap_projects_pgdata`), and the current backend configuration targets 127.0.0.1:5435/sap_brim_ai. Reused that server without changing containers or volumes. The current Compose file names project `sap_brim`, so its ownership mismatch remains unresolved; do not recreate the existing database to resolve it. An inherited `DEBUG=release` prevented Settings construction; set `DEBUG=false` only in the launched backend process environment. No `.env` file was edited; the owner's pre-existing `.env.example` edit was preserved.

Verification completed: PostgreSQL `pg_isready` accepted connections; backend `/health` returned healthy/database connected; frontend `/` and `/src/main.tsx` returned HTTP 200. Backend startup reported the database already at the latest migration. No code changed or regression suite ran. Sign-in, chat generation and provider availability remain unverified.

## RAG failure remediation (2026-10-29)

Removed the evidence-excerpt fallback from LLM generation. When no allowed provider produces text, the API returns a stable unavailable message with null grounding and `verification_status: "unavailable"`; the RAG path skips verification for this state and fails closed on rejected grounding. Provider failures are classified without storing exception text in diagnostics. Regular-user JSON and SSE expose only the unavailable status, while model/provider and failure details remain internal. See `RAG_FAILURE_DIAGNOSIS.md`.

Committed locally as `8b59675` on `audit-fixes`; no push was performed.

## Provider and web fallback follow-up (2026-10-29)

Committed locally as `8641fc3` on `audit-fixes`; no push was performed.

Fixed provider activation defaults: Groq, Gemini, and OpenRouter are now allowed in tier order by default; configured OpenRouter free models are enabled unless `LLM_ALLOW_FREE_TIER=false`; `LLM_PROVIDER=local` uses that allowlisted tier order, while an explicitly empty `LLM_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS` still disables external calls. Corrected RAG web fallback so a low document match triggers web search even when confidence is high and GitHub/multi-source comparison is disabled. Unified search now continues from empty Siftdog/SearXNG results to Tavily. `.env.example` documents the allowlist; the actual `.env` files were not read or changed.

Also added a single web-backed regeneration attempt if the grounding gate rejects an answer even though retrieval scores are strong. Offline focused verification passed 46 backend tests with fake provider/search results, `_env_file=None` applied before app settings construction, and a fake `_test` database URL. Runtime keys, provider quotas, Tavily availability, and network access remain unverified.

Focused verification passed: `test_rag_generation_unavailable.py` plus `test_audit_rag_pipeline.py` (16 passed). It used stubbed providers, offline retrieval, and a fake `_test` database URL; `.env` discovery was disabled before app imports. No real DB or provider was contacted. Runtime `.env` configuration, keys, quotas, and failure rates remain unverified. The current pasted task attachment was truncated mid-sentence, so any instructions after that point were unavailable. Do not stage existing owner edits in `README.md`, `backend/.env.example`, or engineering-memory files.

## Audit remediation continuation (2026-10-29)

Phase 3 continued on branch `audit-fixes`. F-20 is committed as `0da1283`: uploads spool in chunks with per-file and aggregate caps, signature checks, an opt-in extended-format set, a PDF page cap, and chunk-counted request body limits. PDF extraction timeout remains open. F-21 query length is capped at 4,000 characters; daily budgets and message/attachment caps remain open. F-52 hostname checks now use exact/subdomain matching across registry, comparison, confidence, and context-tier paths; commits `80dda9a` and `c67b5e4`. Its focused regression passed. F-53 is committed as `bedece9`: Alembic 0004 adds `documents.source_tier`, defaults unclassified records to `self_authored`, backfills reviewed historical filename tiers, exposes an audited admin classification endpoint, and feeds the tier into retrieval/confidence/context weighting. F-08/F-54 partial safeguards are committed as `704e8fa`: `INCLUDE_SELF_AUTHORED_DOCS=false` excludes project-authored evidence before ranking, misleading generator labels are removed, and owner review is documented in `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md`; existing PDFs and orphaned DB rows remain untouched. F-31 safeguards are committed as `12244f8`: authenticated export and cascade deletion, final-admin protection, plus a 365-day attachment cleanup command that defaults to dry-run.

F-32 is committed as `2fd98a7`: browser profiles, projects, pinned chats, and archived chats are scoped by user ID; logout clears the current user's scoped values and legacy global keys are removed without migration. F-46 is committed as `6e3f0c5` and `88c0879`: upload/delete/processing failures use generic codes in API/SSE and persisted status, with exception details retained in server logs. Verification passed: frontend storage tests (3), full Vitest suite (17), TypeScript check, lint (warnings only), and backend generic error tests (3). No push was performed.

F-07 is partially implemented and committed as `381485e`: hash fallback removed; `EMBEDDING_MODEL` config is honored by both backends; chunks/messages record model/version; dense retrieval excludes incompatible vectors while lexical/identifier retrieval remains; ingestion rebuilds documents whose stored vector provenance differs. Revision 0005 labels pre-existing vectors `legacy-unknown`. Focused embedding/access/migration/retrieval/memory tests passed (42 passed, 5 live deselected). Re-embedding the real corpus was not run; see `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md`. No push was performed.

Earlier commits on this branch: `12244f8` (F-31 partial), `704e8fa` (F-08/F-54 partial), `bedece9` (F-53), `c67b5e4`, `80dda9a` (F-52 partial), `0da1283` (F-20 partial), `1ddf54e` (F-09/F-10/F-21), `0432603` (F-45), `f0a89d6` and `c5625fd` (F-50), `e48a579` (F-05), and `e84d22e` (F-24). No remote was contacted. Owner changes to `README.md`, `backend/.env.example`, and `docs/engineering-memory/*` remain unstaged.

Verification this continuation: F-20 focused security/provider/RAG/upload selection passed 72 tests. F-52/F-53 focused regression, upload-default, and migration selection passed 5 tests; changed F-53 modules compiled with `py_compile`; `git diff --check` passed. Tests that import the retrieval stack need `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=true` on this host to prevent blocked model downloads. Backend `ruff` is unavailable. F-08/F-54 focused tests passed (3 passed); the upload/process/classify/retrieve integration passed (1 passed). F-31 account export/deletion/retention and final-admin protection tests passed (4 passed); database backups remain an owner/deployment action. The earlier full backend baseline stalled at 34% and was interrupted without a final result.

Remaining: most Phase 3 findings and Phases 4 through 6 remain open. F-20 extraction timeout, F-21 daily per-user budgets and message/attachment caps, F-52 upstream web license/gate metadata trust, F-08 identifier-claim evidence enforcement and F-54 orphan-record cleanup; F-31 verified encrypted backups, direct PostgreSQL retrieval, ingestion reliability, dependency/Docker/CI changes, and the human-authored evaluation runner/metrics remain. No corpus re-chunk/re-embed was run. Keep all user work outside the explicit audit commit paths unstaged.

## Audit remediation in progress (branch `audit-fixes`, local only, not pushed)

Phases 1–2 of the fixes for `AUDIT_REPORT.md` (untracked, root) are committed: 15 findings fixed, F-26/F-27/F-33 partial. Read `AUDIT_FIX_LOG.md` (status per finding, before/after test numbers), `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` (secret rotation, history rewrite, licensing, provider approval, the backup to take **before** first starting this branch against the real DB, SSO/BFF plan) and `CHANGELOG_AUDIT.md` (API/config changes, incl. breaking: registration off by default, new JWT claims, save-partial body). Schema is now Alembic-managed (`backend/alembic.ini`, revisions 0001–0003); startup migrates when `AUTO_MIGRATE=true`. Next: Phase 3 (prompt injection/output filtering F-09/F-10, LLM egress F-05, logging F-24, limits F-20/F-21, F-52/F-53, F-08/F-54, F-31, F-32, F-46). Test command: blank the LLM/search keys, set `DEBUG=false WEB_FALLBACK_ENABLED=false`, run `pytest backend/tests -m "not live"` against `sap_brim_ai_test` (container `sap_assistant_postgres`). After Phase 2: 411 passed, 6 pre-existing failures (listed in the log). A scratch DB `sap_brim_ai_empty_test` exists for the fresh-build migration test.

## Setup documentation update (2026-10-28)

Added `docker-setup/README.md` as a portable new-machine guide. The root README links to it, drops workstation-specific paths, and corrects outdated guest and admin-provisioning instructions. `backend/.env.example` now matches the 15-minute access-token setting and documents development CORS origins. No actual `.env` values were used in documentation. Verification: `docker compose config --quiet` exited successfully (Docker CLI emitted a local config-file access warning); documented relative paths exist; `git diff --check` passed. No application tests were run for this documentation-only change.

## Security remediation handover (2026-10-28)

This session implemented an initial security remediation based on the untracked `backend/tests/test_security_audit_characterization.py`; the referenced `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` was not present in the checkout. Existing user work was preserved and the characterization test was replaced with secure behavior regressions.

Changed: public demo login and browser guest/trial fallback removed; registration always creates consultant/non-admin accounts and password minimum raised to 12 characters with a bcrypt 72-byte cap; existing configured admin email is no longer auto-promoted; access JWTs shortened to 15 minutes, require standard claims and token version, and `/auth/logout` revokes all existing tokens for that user; document extraction requires authentication, reads at most 10 MiB plus one byte, and validates a file extension allowlist; synchronous and streaming direct RAG responses strip citations/evidence scores/comparison metadata for regular users; server-side process-local request limits and content-length rejection added; CORS now uses configured origins, production refuses wildcard origins and rejects HTTP; basic browser security headers added; administrator processing SSE uses Authorization header through fetch streaming instead of URL query credentials; share links have owner-controlled revocation and an explicit disclosure; hardcoded SearXNG fallback secret removed.

Verification: 20 focused backend security/auth/RAG/extraction tests passed after updating legacy tests to use authenticated test principals. Frontend `npm.cmd test` passed (10 tests), `npm.cmd run build` passed, `py -3.14 -m compileall -q backend` passed, and `git diff --check` passed. The first backend test invocation was blocked by invalid local `DEBUG=release`; setting process `DEBUG=false` allowed tests to run. `npm.cmd audit --omit=dev` could not reach the npm advisory endpoint; `pip_audit` is not installed. No dependency upgrade/lockfile resolution was completed.

Remaining security work/blockers: no MFA; no refresh-token renewal flow (short access tokens currently require re-login); rate buckets are per process and not shared across replicas, with no password-hash concurrency semaphore; content-length rejection does not protect chunked requests and multipart parsing happens before endpoint byte checks; document parser resource limits/content-signature validation need dedicated hardening; shared links have revocation but no expiry setting; validate logout/revocation against real PostgreSQL and run wider suite. Admin provisioning remains operator-managed by provisioning the account outside public registration; current startup only creates a new account when configured email is absent and does not grant privileges to an existing matching account. Production TLS termination, trusted proxy scheme forwarding, origin values, HSTS, and deployment-level CSP/security headers remain unverified assumptions. Pin/scan dependency tree using reachable scanner and review the supplied audit report if added to workspace.

Current branch: `security-remediation-20261028`. The security remediation commit is local and was not pushed because its branch history includes knowledge-base PDFs and internal reports excluded from the user's push authorization.

## Current application state

Docker Desktop was recovered after WSL logs showed `/dev/sde` formatting failed (`mkfs` exit 1) and `docker_data.vhdx` could not detach. `wsl --shutdown` followed by `docker desktop start` brought Docker Desktop back without deleting containers or volumes. The existing `sap_brim_pgdata` volume remains attached.

`docker compose up -d postgres searxng siftdog` succeeds. PostgreSQL is healthy on `127.0.0.1:5434`; `sap_brim_ai` app role/database works. Backend was launched with `py -3.14 -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload`; `/health` reports healthy, 62 documents, 12,406 chunks. Frontend Vite is running at 127.0.0.1:5173. Swagger `/docs`, frontend `/`, Siftdog `/health`, and SearXNG `/` returned HTTP 200.

Database snapshot via read-only SQL: databases `postgres`, `sap_assistant`, `sap_brim_ai`, and `sap_brim_ai_test`; 62 documents, 12,406 chunks, 2 users, 1 chat, 6 messages; pgvector 0.8.7. No backup was created. Do not claim a backup exists or reset Docker/volumes before making and verifying one.

Compose health-check caveat: `pg_isready -U sap_assistant -d sap_assistant` is only a server readiness probe and does not authenticate. The `sap_assistant` database exists but the `sap_assistant` role is absent in the existing cluster; `sap_brim_ai` role connects and backend `/health` proves the app connection. Consider aligning healthcheck with an authenticated SQL query, but assess whether it will recreate the PG container and back up first.

## Checks and blockers

* `docker compose up -d postgres searxng siftdog` — passed after WSL recovery; all three containers running.
* `docker exec sap_assistant_postgres pg_isready -U sap_assistant -d sap_assistant` — readiness returned true, but see authentication caveat above.
* `Test-NetConnection 127.0.0.1 -Port 5434` — passed.
* Read-only SQL counts and vector extension — passed; see `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
* Backend `/health`, `/docs`, frontend `/`, Siftdog `/health`, SearXNG `/` — HTTP 200/healthy.
* Backend compilation and frontend build passed in the previous task. The full backend suite previously collected 331 tests but crashed in Python 3.14 Torch/Transformers during admin ingestion before final counts; not rerun after Docker recovery.
* Full regression run on updated RAG pipeline (`backend/tests/test_adaptive_rag_pipeline.py`, `backend/tests/test_solution_design_answers.py`, `backend/tests/test_senior_upgrade_and_reconciliation.py`, `backend/tests/test_answer_style_router.py`, `backend/tests/test_sap_restriction.py`, `backend/tests/test_citation_provenance.py`, `backend/tests/test_security.py`) passed (80 passed in 7.03s).
* No DB backup/restore created yet.

## Current RAG Answer Generation State

Adaptive response generation for complex SAP BRIM scenarios has been implemented:
1. `answer_planner.py`: Added `production_incident` archetype with mandatory 10-section structure.
2. `answer_style_router.py`: `production_incident` routed with max_sections=10, detailed level, procedural steps, and 10-section layout.
3. `evidence_selection_service.py`: Dynamic scaling of internal_top_k up to 16 chunks for multi-aspect incident queries (replaces rigid 4-chunk bottleneck).
4. `rag_service.py`: Incident aspect splitting across CC, CI, FI-CA, safe recovery, and reconciliation. Diagnostic tracking in `process_query` and `stream_query`.
5. `llm_service.py`: Output continuation on length cutoff (`_continue_gemini`, `_continue_openrouter`), token diagnostic tracking, adaptive word targets (100–250 words simple, 400–800 words intermediate, 1,200–2,000 words complex incident target).
6. Tests: `backend/tests/test_adaptive_rag_pipeline.py` (10 tests covering Tests A–F) all passing.

Next three tasks:

1. Create and verify an external logical backup of `sap_brim_ai` and, if required, the full cluster before any reset/recreation.
2. Run end-to-end frontend integration tests with streaming and verifying that long Markdown answers (including all 10 incident sections) render seamlessly in the UI without markdown breakage.
3. Decide whether to repair the Compose healthcheck's nonexistent `sap_assistant` role assumption; back up first if applying the change would recreate PostgreSQL. Keep all existing volumes and unrelated containers.

Read first: `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md`, `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, then `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and the affected README/Docker configuration.


## Python version guidance (2026-10-31)

Updated user-facing setup guidance and actionable backend migration/compile examples to standardize on Python 3.12. Historical audit commands and outcomes remain unchanged because they record the Python 3.14 environment used at the time. git diff --check passed; no tests were run for this documentation and command-text update. Runtime verification under Python 3.12 remains unverified. Preserve existing owner edits to engineering-memory files and other modified files.

## Python 3.12 project pin (2026-10-31)

Added repository .python-version set to 3.12; backend requirements identify the supported runtime; README and Docker setup create venvs explicitly with py -3.12 on Windows or python3.12 on macOS/Linux; actionable maintenance/deployment commands now use 3.12. py -3.12 --version was attempted and reported no suitable Python runtime installed/registered. Therefore the project files are pinned, but this workstation runtime/dependency installation has not been migrated or verified. No tests were run. git diff --check passed. Historical audit records remain in their original Python version context.

## Python 3.12 runtime installation follow-up (2026-10-31)

Installed Python 3.12.10 with winget from the verified python.org installer. The legacy Windows py launcher still lists only system Python 3.14, so py -3.12 is unavailable on this machine; the per-user interpreter is at %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe. Created project .venv with that interpreter and installed ackend/requirements.txt. Verification passed: .venv\Scripts\python.exe --version reports Python 3.12.10; pip check reported no broken requirements; backend compileall passed; git diff --check passed. No tests were run. Keep using the activated .venv for local backend commands. The prior 3.12-pinned setup instructions assume Python launcher registration and should be adjusted if a fresh Windows install also fails to register with py.

## Sprint and Scholar chat modes (2026-10-31)

The current working tree contains Sprint/Scholar chat routing: frontend starts each newly opened chat in Sprint, sends mode with message/edit requests, and displays the selected mode description. Sprint checks SAP scope and calls the configured direct LLM provider fallback without retrieval, embeddings, or RAG; Scholar continues through the existing RAG handlers. Mode selection is UI state, so reopening any chat starts in Sprint. Added a Sprint source badge to satisfy TypeScript.

Verification: `backend/tests/test_chat_modes.py` passed (3 tests) under Python 3.14 with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=true` and `DEBUG=false`; Python 3.12 `.venv` could not collect because FastAPI is absent there. Frontend tests passed (18); production build passed after the badge type fix; `git diff --check` passed. Runtime provider behavior was not exercised. Existing unrelated working-tree changes were preserved.

## Chat welcome mode descriptions (2026-10-31)

Moved Sprint and Scholar explanations from the fixed composer banner to selectable mode cards on the empty-chat welcome screen. The cards show which mode is active and switch the same chat mode as the composer toggle; the attachment/send area no longer has a mode-description panel.

Verification: frontend tests passed (18 tests); TypeScript and production build passed. `git diff --check` passed. An initial Vite bundle attempt hit a transient memory allocation failure; the immediate retry passed.

## Welcome page visual refinement (2026-10-31)

Refined the empty chat welcome view with compact Sprint/Scholar selectors, a restrained slate and teal palette, smaller icon and prompt cards, and a simple "Suggested questions" label. Removed the pulsing status indicator and unsupported "Verified SAP Intelligence" claim to keep the screen clear and credible.

Verification: frontend tests passed (18); TypeScript and production build passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## Welcome copy update (2026-10-31)

Updated the chat welcome heading to "Welcome to Clyptus AI" and supporting line to "Ask any question," above the mode selectors and SAP prompt suggestions. Frontend production build passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## Composer mode control refinement (2026-10-31)

Reduced the Sprint/Scholar toggle footprint beside the upload control and changed its active state to a restrained teal treatment with clearer compact typography.

Verification: frontend tests passed (18); TypeScript and production build passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## Company logo color reference (2026-10-31)

Saved the visual brand palette in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: logo orange `#FF6600` (sampled from `company-logo.png`), white, and black/charcoal, with slate neutrals. Replaced teal highlights in the chat mode selector and welcome screen with the logo orange. Keep this palette for later UI work.

Verification: frontend tests passed (18); TypeScript and production build passed; `git diff --check` passed.

## SAP 72 welcome typography (2026-10-31)

Added SAP 72 Regular, Semibold, and Bold WOFF2 files from SAP's theming-base-content repository and applied them only within the chat welcome screen. Font files include Apache 2.0 license and source notice; other application typography remains unchanged.

Verification: frontend tests passed (18); TypeScript and production build passed, with all three WOFF2 weights emitted as local assets; `git diff --check` passed.

## Tavily-only web search (2026-10-31)

Removed SearXNG and Siftdog code and configuration: Docker Compose services, provider adapters, extraction/crawl/site-map interfaces, settings and example variables, live/unit integration tests, and their setup/integration documentation. Search and image retrieval now use Tavily only; empty or unavailable Tavily results produce no external evidence. No DuckDuckGo scraping fallback remains. Actual `.env` files were not read or edited. Docker containers were not inspected or stopped because this session cannot access the Docker Engine; old container status is unverified.

Verification passed: Tavily provider, web evidence, Tavily image, provider fallback, RAG generation unavailable, and audit RAG selections (35 tests total); Python 3.14 compileall; docker compose config --quiet; and git diff --check. Tests used HF_HUB_OFFLINE=true, DEBUG=false, a fake _test database URL, and a BaseSettings wrapper setting _env_file=None; no real DB/provider was contacted. The Docker CLI emitted a local config-file access warning, but Compose config validation exited successfully. Tavily API credentials and live service behavior were not exercised.

## Production-quality review and test pass (2026-10-31)

Reviewed the current implementation and tests without opening either `.env` file. The worktree already contained substantial owner changes; preserve them. Removed two unused catch bindings and five unused Markdown node bindings in `frontend/public/theme-init.js`, `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`, and `frontend/src/pages/DocumentManagementPage.tsx`. Updated `backend/tests/test_document_management_dashboard.py` to expect the stable `DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_FAILED` response instead of parser internals, consistent with generic document-error handling.

Verification: frontend Vitest 18 passed; production TypeScript/Vite build passed; `npm run lint` completed with 22 React/style warnings remaining; backend `compileall` passed; Compose config validation exited 0 with Docker config-access warnings; `git diff --check` passed. Focused backend dashboard/generic-error tests passed (4). Python 3.12 `.venv` collection is blocked because FastAPI, PyMuPDF, and JWT dependencies are missing. Used global Python 3.14.4 for broader backend checks. `pip check` on that global interpreter reports conflicts from unrelated installed packages; Ruff is not installed.

The non-live backend suite contains 476 collected tests (7 live deselected). The completed `--maxfail=1` broad run, additionally excluding two long real-corpus tests, stopped after 226 passed with one failure: `test_integration_real_retriever_and_chunk_uuids` retrieves a SOM chunk scored 0.5425 for a CI question; packing correctly rejects it below `RETRIEVAL_CALIBRATED_THRESHOLD=0.6761`. This is a real-corpus retrieval-quality issue or a corpus-specific integration expectation and needs investigation; do not lower the grounding threshold just to satisfy the test. Another legacy dashboard expectation was corrected and its focused regression passed. Full backend verification remains incomplete: the real-corpus tests `test_15_graceful_operation_empty_history` and `test_rag_query_with_attached_document` each ran for multiple minutes without completion and were interrupted. Conversation-memory tests excluding the first slow case passed (18); BP block regression passed (12). Provider credentials/live Tavily behavior, production backups, and deployment networking remain unverified.

Next: investigate why the real CI query retrieves SOM evidence and make the integration fixture deterministic while retaining the low-evidence fail-closed behavior. Add offline fixtures or explicit time bounds to real RAG tests so the non-live suite cannot call unbounded model/retrieval paths. Ensure the supported Python 3.12 environment is provisioned from backend requirements before deployment verification. Continue the remaining production actions and blockers recorded in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md`.

## RAG hot-path loop cleanup and latency review (2026-10-31)

Reviewed the Scholar RAG pipeline for redundant loops and latency. Removed three output-identical redundant loops in `grounding_service.py`, `retrieval_service.py`, and `rag_service._retrieve_aspect_evidence`; added `backend/tests/test_rag_hot_path_loops.py` (4 passed). An old-vs-new equivalence harness (scratchpad only, not committed) showed identical results. The structural latency causes are recorded as `PERF-001` in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. No changes were committed; existing owner edits were preserved.

Unused code noted but not removed (needs owner decision): `reranking_service.compare_and_select` and `rerank` have no callers; `grounded_generator_service.py` and `context_packing_service.py` are used only by tests and `backend/scripts/run_real_samples.py`, not the app; `llm_service.generate_with_primary_model` (with a fixed 2 s sleep) is used only by `backend/evaluation/run_full_dev_baseline.py`; `RAGService.query` falls back to a `MagicMock` session in production code; the streaming memory branches repeat word-by-word token loops instead of `_verified_token_events`.

Unverified: live provider/Tavily latency, real-corpus timings (benchmarks used synthetic chunks on a loaded host), and DB-backed tests (no PostgreSQL listener). Next: instrument per-stage timings on a live request before changing thresholds, timeouts, or model lists.

## Sprint conversation memory (2026-10-31)

Sprint now uses conversation memory while still never loading the embedding model or calling retrieval. `messages._sprint_memory` classifies the memory intent: first/last-question lookups are answered verbatim from the database (`conversation_memory_service.exact_lookup_answer`, excluding the current message); history, mixed, and cross-conversation recall use `search_history(..., use_embeddings=False)` (keyword scoring only); the chat's rolling summary is passed to the Sprint prompt. Recall questions bypass the SAP-only scope refusal, and the Sprint system prompt allows answering from conversation context. Sprint turns now update the rolling summary (sync and streaming). Sprint messages are still stored without embeddings, so Scholar's semantic recall finds them only by keywords. Also fixed: the synchronous Sprint refusal lacked `grounding_score`, which `send_message` reads when persisting. Scholar's `rag_service` still has its own copy of the first/last lookup text; it could reuse `exact_lookup_answer`.

Verification: `test_sprint_conversation_memory.py` (8) plus `test_chat_modes.py` (3) passed. The wider selection passed 93; 2 failures and 22 errors were all PostgreSQL connection errors (no DB listener), including the DB-backed `test_conversation_memory.py` suite, so the new `get_first_user_message` exclusion filter and summary updates for Sprint are not verified against a real database. No frontend change: `conversation_memory` is not in the frontend source-type union, the same as for existing Scholar memory answers. Nothing committed.

## Landing page, colour system and welcome screen (2026-11-01)

Rewrote public copy so it matches the code: landing page, FAQ, Features, How-it-works and two login-page lines. Removed false claims (cross-encoder reranking, "<250ms neural rerank", "100% grounded citations", "zero hallucination", citations on every answer) and the login page's backend stack disclosure. Added a Sprint/Scholar section. Example T-codes that could not be verified were replaced with questions that ask for the transaction instead.

Unified colours on the logo orange `#FF6600`: see the colour-system notes in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Primary orange buttons now use charcoal text (white on `#FF6600` fails AA); this is a visible change from the previous white text. Rebuilt the chat welcome screen (data in `components/chat/welcomeContent.ts`) and changed the subtitle from "Ask any question" to an SAP-scoped line, because Sprint and Scholar refuse non-SAP questions. The heading "Welcome to Clyptus AI" was kept as the owner chose it, although other pages use "Clyptus.AI" and the footer/meta use "Clyptusap.ai"; brand naming is an owner decision.

Verification: Vitest 23 passed; production build passed; `git diff --check` passed; headless Chrome screenshots reviewed (dark/light landing, welcome screen in both modes). Not verified: real phone widths below about 526px (headless Chrome minimum window width), the authenticated chat page with the composer, and the admin pages after the global colour remap. The remap also touched sidebar and app-shell rules in `index.css`; check them visually in both themes before release. Nothing committed.

## Public nav: Sign in / Sign up (2026-11-01)

The landing nav now shows a plain logo and two actions: Sign in (`/login?mode=login`) and Sign up (`/login?mode=register`, the Create Account tab of `LoginPage`). Blocker for sign-up: the backend keeps public registration off by default (`REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false`, audit F-01), so the form returns "Self-registration is disabled. Ask an administrator for an account." until an owner enables it (optionally with `INVITE_CODE`). Not changed here because it is a security decision. `pages/RegisterPage.tsx` is unused and outdated (6-character password minimum, no route); delete it or route it after an owner decision. Verified with Vitest (27 passed), build, and screenshots; nothing committed.

## Sign-in page split layout (2026-11-01)

The sign-in page now has a brand panel on the left and the form on the right. No official company photo exists in the repo, so the left panel uses the official logo plus a brand SVG (`frontend/src/assets/login-visual.svg`); swap the `loginVisual` import in `LoginPage.tsx` to use a real photo. "Create an organisation" is a disabled placeholder under the form: the owner will specify its behaviour next (expected to need backend support: organisation model, admin/owner role, invites). Remove `disabled` and the "Coming soon" badge when it is wired up, and update `LoginPage.test.tsx`. Nothing committed.

## Sign-in page refresh (2026-11-01)

Sign-in now uses one landing-style canvas, a frozen form column on desktop, and a shield-plus-quotation in place of the session notice; details in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. The quotation makes two claims, both true of the current code: chats are private to the account unless shared, and Scholar verifies answers before display. Revisit it if sharing or verification behaviour changes. The existing `set-state-in-effect` lint warning for the `?mode=` sync in `LoginPage.tsx` remains. `OnboardingPage` still uses the older `login-layout`/`login-safe` styles.

## Organisation Portal (2026-11-01)

Implemented and verified (uncommitted); contract and implementation notes in `docs/ORGANISATION_PORTAL.md`, results in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`.

Important: the owner's dev server (`uvicorn ... --reload` on port 8000) reloaded the new backend code and, because `AUTO_MIGRATE` defaults to true, migrated the real `sap_brim_ai` database to `0006_organisations`. The migration is additive; a read-only check after it found 0 organisations, codes or shared answers (no test data leaked) and all 4 users as active individual accounts without forced password changes. Downgrade path exists in the revision but was not run. Consider `AUTO_MIGRATE=false` for the dev server while backend schema work is in progress.

Environment: this host has about 1.5-2 GB free RAM. Under load the Docker VM restarted twice mid-test (Postgres "server closed the connection"), OpenBLAS failed to allocate in a subprocess, Python 3.14 hit access violations when many test files ran in one process, and Vitest workers timed out. Run backend tests one file per process with `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`, and Vitest with `--maxWorkers=1`. Every such failure passed on a clean rerun.

Open follow-ups: e-mail delivery for activation codes and member invitations (currently shown once for manual hand-over); ownership transfer; rate limits are per process unless `REDIS_URL` is set; `_guard_login`/`/auth/login` failure audit rows still store full e-mail addresses (pre-existing; org login stores a fingerprint); the Agentic AI chatbot is marketing copy only. Not verified in a real browser session: modal focus trapping and clipboard fallbacks; widths below about 526px.

## Sprint small talk (2026-11-01)

Sprint no longer refuses greetings, thanks, feelings and identity questions. `messages._sprint_route` (shared by sync and streaming Sprint) orders memory answer → SAP answer → small talk → refusal. Small talk only applies when the turn would otherwise be refused, has no attachments, and `query_router` returns EMOTIONAL_CASUAL; the reply comes from the existing casual presets/LLM path with `SPRINT_CASUAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, source type `conversational`. Scholar's casual path is unchanged (the new `system_prompt` parameter defaults to its old prompt). Details and test counts in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`.

Owner decisions noted, not changed: (1) in a chat that already has SAP questions, "hi"/"thanks"/"who are you?" still go to the Sprint SAP prompt (previous behaviour), because putting small talk first would hijack follow-ups such as "ok, what about dunning?"; (2) the shared router also counts "tell me a joke" and "write a poem" as casual, so Sprint now answers those in one sentence, as Scholar already did; (3) the shared preset for "who are you?" says "Clyptus.AI, your dedicated SAP BRIM Solution Architect and Assistant", while LLM-written identity replies say "Clyptus.AI Sprint".

Unverified: live provider replies to `SPRINT_CASUAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (tests stub the provider); DB-backed suites (`test_query_router` fixtures, `test_edit_prompt`, `test_followup_and_greetings::test_conversational_rag_service_flow`, `test_sap_restriction::test_rag_endpoint_refusal`, `test_audit_partial`) errored only because PostgreSQL was not running. Rerun them with the test DB up. Nothing committed.

## Scholar latency fixes (2026-11-01)

Measured a live Scholar request stage by stage (test DB, configured providers) before changing anything; see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` PERF-001 for numbers. Fixed, behaviour-preserving: the retrieval index (about 10 s for 31k chunks) is built in a background thread at startup and 5 s after `invalidate_cache()` (`RETRIEVAL_CACHE_WARMUP`); the multi-source comparator searches question parts concurrently (max 4); `model_cooldowns` in `llm_service` skips models after a 404/decommissioned (1 h), a 429 (retry-after, else 30 s) or a timeout (60 s), in all provider loops, the style classifier and the query rewriter (now `max_retries=0`, 10 s timeout). Live after: first question after startup 16.8 s to 9.6 s, typical 6.2 s to 5.2 s, 6-part web stage 27.4 s to 8.6 s.

Owner decisions (not changed; `.env` not edited): (1) `MULTI_SOURCE_COMPARE_ENABLED=true` and `REPO_SOURCE_ENABLED=true` in the local `.env` make every Scholar question run Tavily (2.5-4.8 s per part) even when the knowledge base matches at 0.92-0.98, and web evidence won both measured comparisons; the default `false` keeps web search for weak evidence only. (2) `LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile` returns 404 for this Groq key; set a working model. (3) Groq free-tier per-minute token limits push large prompts (incident/design answers) to Gemini, 25-34 s per call; the grounding repair pass regenerates the whole answer (+25 s when it triggers). (4) `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` would save about 5 s of startup once the embedding model is cached.

Verification: `test_scholar_latency.py` 14 passed; full non-live suite per file 564 passed / 12 failed / 2 skipped, all 12 explained in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (none from these changes; the 2 comparator failures reproduce on HEAD's file). Pre-existing test drift to resolve: `test_query_router` expects `direct_llm` for greetings, the code returns `conversational`; `test_repo_retrieval_and_comparison` KB-vs-repo winner tests. I started the `sap_assistant_postgres` container for the measurements and stopped it afterwards. Nothing committed.

## One .env file (2026-11-02)

The project now has a single settings file, the repository-root `.env` (template `.env.example`), read by Docker Compose and by `backend/app/config.py`. The local `backend/.env` was merged into it without printing values and deleted; 17 dead SearXNG/Siftdog/`SEARCH_*` keys were dropped. Backups of both originals are the git-ignored `.env.bak` and `backend/.env.bak`: delete them once the owner has started the backend and Compose successfully. `backend/.env.example` was merged into `.env.example` and deleted (a tracked deletion). Details and verification in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`.

Verified: all 133 declared settings fields are unchanged; `docker compose config` output is byte-identical; `test_single_env_file.py` (6) and the startup/database-URL tests (5) passed under Python 3.14. Not verified: an actual backend start or `docker compose up` with the merged file (both are config-equivalent by the checks above). Other checkouts or teammates that still have `backend/.env` must move its keys into the root `.env`; the backend no longer reads it. The backend now also loads the Compose-only keys (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `SAP_BRIM_DB_PASSWORD`, ...) as unused `Settings` extras (`extra="allow"`); nothing serializes settings today, but keep it that way. Nothing committed.

## SETUP.md, README rewrite and push to main (2026-11-02)

Added `SETUP.md` (single setup/deployment/troubleshooting guide) and rewrote `README.md` from the implementation; `docker.md` holds backup/restore; `docker-setup/README.md` points to `SETUP.md`. Fixed `backend/requirements.txt` (alembic, PyJWT, PyMuPDF, google-generativeai, python-docx, email-validator were imported but missing), completed `.env.example`, extended `.gitignore`. Details and verification in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`; new issues SETUP-001, FE-001 and API-001 in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

Pushed to `origin/main` (Clyptus-Soft/SAP_BRIM_Ai, private) as a fast-forward after merging `origin/main` into `audit-fixes`; this also published the 54 earlier local `audit-fixes` commits. `AUDIT_REPORT.md` (root, untracked, open security findings) was deliberately not committed. The knowledge-base PDFs were already on the remote (`SE-updated-rag-kb`, identical blobs); their licensing decision (`HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` §3) is still open.

Blockers and environment notes (SETUP.md session): drive C: was full (about 130 MB free) during this session; the fresh-install check ran on D: and its folder `D:\claude-setup-check` (venv, pip cache) was left for the owner to delete because the removal needs human approval. The project `.venv` (Python 3.12) now has the full backend requirements installed. I restarted the `sap_assistant_postgres` container for tests and stopped it again afterwards. Fresh installs need document tiers set before Scholar retrieves anything (SETUP-001). Unverified: `docker compose up` on a brand-new volume, `ingest.py` on a fresh database (not run: it would re-embed the real corpus), and a production deployment.

## Scholar fallback chain and the "couldn't generate a verified response" bug (2026-11-02)

Root cause: not a provider outage. All three LLM tiers work. The claim verifier rejected a generated answer, and the pipeline replaced it with the generic message (audit F-03 fail-closed rule); the web retry was skipped because web search had already run. Fixed in `rag_service.py`:
- a rejected answer has its unconfirmed, contradicted and critical claims removed and is published with a notice, never as `verified`;
- if no LLM tier answers, approved SAP web results become a linked `unverified` answer;
- only if that also fails does the user get `ALL_METHODS_UNAVAILABLE_RESPONSE`.

`llm_service.py` now skips a whole provider for an hour after a rejected key and logs which tier answered. Details: `RAG_FAILURE_DIAGNOSIS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md`. Nothing committed.

Verified: `test_llm_web_fallback_chain.py` 19 passed; related RAG/LLM files pass except the 7 explained failures in `CHANGELOG_ENGINEERING.md` (none caused by this change); frontend tsc/Vitest 77/build passed. Live runs against `sap_brim_ai_test` covered:
- the reported question;
- the complex components question;
- forced Groq outage (Gemini answered) and forced Groq+Gemini outage (OpenRouter answered);
- forced all-tier outage (live Tavily answer with links);
- forced gate rejection (published `partial` with the note).

Owner actions and open points:
1. Set `LLM_MODEL` in `.env` to a model the Groq key can use (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile` 404s); `gemini-3.8-flash` is over quota (`KNOWN_ISSUES.md` LLM-002).
2. Policy change to confirm: F-03 "unverified drafts are never shown" no longer holds for Scholar. Rejected answers are shown with a note. Landing and How-it-works copy was adjusted; other marketing lines still say "verified answer" broadly (FAQ, AssistantGuideModal, login visual) and may need review.
3. Answer quality, separate from this bug: with `MULTI_SOURCE_COMPARE_ENABLED=true` the comparator often picks thin web passages over richer knowledge-base chunks. The complex components answer was verified but listed components without their functions.
4. Sprint is unchanged: it has no web fallback and still uses `UNAVAILABLE_RESPONSE` when no tier answers.
5. No whole-request generation deadline (LLM-003). Uptime-dependent test bug TEST-002.

Environment: commit memory on this host dropped to about 0.4-1.7 GB free and C: had 0.2-2.7 GB free. The first repro hit `MemoryError`; the `sap_assistant_postgres` container exited (code 0) mid-run and was restarted, and it is left running as it was at session start. Blank keys for tests with bash `env VAR=` (PowerShell `$env:VAR=''` deletes the variable, so the real `.env` keys load).


Login follow-up (2026-11-03): read-only checks found that the account shown in the owner's screenshot does not exist in the connected database. Self-registration is disabled and no invite is configured. No accounts, passwords or registration settings were changed. Account creation or enabling local signup needs the owner's intended next step; successful login remains unverified.

Direct-login account (2026-11-03): at the owner's request, created one new active individual consultant account with a randomly generated password and verified HTTP 200 plus token issuance through /api/auth/login. Credentials were delivered only in chat, not saved to repository files. Existing accounts were not modified; public registration remains disabled. No application code changed; chat generation remains unverified.

Admin login resolved (2026-11-03): active settings had no SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD and the intended admin did not exist. Copied only the owner's two supplied admin settings from .env.example into git-ignored root .env without printing values; ran the existing seed_super_admin function and confirmed the new account's admin flag and password. Verified /api/auth/admin-login returned HTTP 200, a token and admin user. Existing users were preserved; no restart was required for the new database account to work. No application code changed or regression suite ran. Credentials were not written to engineering memory.

Sprint unavailable resolved (2026-11-03): active .env had no Groq/Gemini/OpenRouter or web-search keys. The owner's .env.example contained a Groq key; copied only GROQ_API_KEY to the git-ignored active .env without displaying it, then restarted the existing uvicorn backend with DEBUG=false. Current backend logs: backend-provider.stdout.log and backend-provider.stderr.log. Groq model discovery via httpx returned HTTP 200 and the configured primary model was available (urllib alone returned 403). Live stream_sprint_reply for the screenshot's SAP billable-item question completed successfully with 4,601 response characters; no test chat was persisted. Restarted backend /health returned healthy/database connected. No application code changed, no regression suite ran, and git diff --check passed. Scholar retrieval/web fallback and full browser chat remain unverified; other provider and web-search keys remain absent.

Sidebar shortcut removal (2026-11-03): removed only the bottom-left Organisation NavLink from frontend/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx and its unused imports. Organisation modules, route guards, routes and account-routing helpers are unchanged. Updated AppLayout.test.tsx to cover individual, organisation-member and super-admin sidebars and retained Guide, Settings and Admin Dashboard links. Focused AppLayout/accountRouting/OrgRoutes Vitest run: 14 passed (elevated execution required after sandbox spawn EPERM). TypeScript check pending at time of this note; see subsequent verification note. Existing owner edits to .env.example and earlier memory edits preserved.

Sidebar final verification: npm exec tsc -- -b completed successfully; git diff --check passed and the relevant implementation/test diff was reviewed. No blockers; browser visual inspection was not performed.

Pull completed (2026-11-03): main fast-forwarded from 6226994 to origin/main 9dcae91 (Scholar fallback changes and admin UI toggles/bulk document deletion). Saved tracked local changes using stash before pull; restored all edits and resolved NEXT_SESSION.md conflicts by retaining upstream and local handover notes. All local edits are unstaged; stash@{0}, named Local work preserved before pull 2026-11-03, remains as a backup. Verified local .env.example and AppLayout implementation/tests match their pre-pull saved content. Active git-ignored .env was untouched by Git. Post-pull verification: complete frontend Vitest suite 83 passed (15 files), backend /health healthy/database connected, frontend HTTP 200, HEAD and origin/main have zero divergence, git diff --check passed. No backend regression suite or live Scholar request was run after the pull; no unresolved Git conflicts remain.

Light default theme (2026-11-03): removed the HTML shell's dark class, made theme-color white, and changed theme-init.js, AppLayout and SettingsPage to default to light. Saved explicit Dark/System choices remain supported; the bootstrap now resolves System before React renders and falls back to light if storage is blocked. No organisation/backend modules or theme styling were refactored. Added theme.test.tsx (13 cases covering defaults, saved preferences, system appearance, storage errors, Settings selection and HTML shell). Full frontend suite: 96 passed (16 files); TypeScript tsc -b passed after adding Node type references for the VM-based test. No browser visual inspection performed. Existing browsers with an explicit saved dark preference must choose Light once in Settings; that preference is intentionally preserved.

Light theme completeness follow-up (2026-11-03): the previous default change did not cover fixed-dark admin surfaces. Added light colour utility classes with original dark variants to AdminDashboard, AdminLoginPage, AdminProtectedRoute, AssistantGuideModal, RAGInspectorPanel, ShareModal and GroundingScoreBadge. Verified mechanically that removing the added colour pairs exactly reconstructs each original component: no business logic or module behaviour changed. theme-init.js now switches old saved Dark/System preferences to Light once, guarded by clyptus-light-default-v1=applied; choices made afterward persist normally. Added legacy-preference migration, admin/loading/denied and dialog regressions. Full frontend Vitest suite: 106 passed (17 files); tsc -b passed. Isolated headless Chrome verified 14 light-surface checks (admin sign-in/input, all six dashboard tabs, workspace, settings, profile, landing, login and organisation portal), including migration from a saved Dark preference. Screenshots in git-ignored scratch/light-theme-check; admin login, sandbox and Document Manager images visually inspected. The first browser runs hit backend reload/startup delays; the final full run completed successfully. Production build verification is recorded separately below. User edits and local sidebar removal preserved.

Final light-theme verification: npm run build completed successfully (TypeScript plus Vite production bundle); git diff --check passed and relevant component/test diffs reviewed. No outstanding blockers. Browser checks exercised light mode; dark variants were retained and unit-tested as preferences, but not exhaustively visually checked.

Accounts inner-panel light fix (2026-11-03): the screenshot revealed an additional fixed-dark .org-console palette in components/organisation/organisation.css. Earlier browser checks measured the outer admin page and missed these nested surfaces. Scoped the console palette and all console-specific form/status overrides under .dark; Accounts panels now inherit global light tokens, including table, search, badges and dialogs. Console tab labels/separators use inherited tokens. No component logic changed. Added organisationTheme.test.ts (3 regressions). Focused theme/admin tests: 8 passed; npm run build passed. Isolated browser verified the actual Organisations and Individual users .org-console panels are white, search is white, and populated table header is slate-100; final Individual users screenshot visually inspected at scratch/light-theme-check/admin-individuals.png. Initial browser attempts reused a signed-in profile or checked before table load; final run used a fresh profile and waited for the populated table. git diff --check passed, relevant CSS diff reviewed. No unresolved blocker; no full regression rerun for this CSS-only follow-up.

Profile-specific projects and pins (2026-11-03): the screenshot's SAP BRIM Architecture folder was a hardcoded auto-pinned sample returned for every account, not a shared user-created project. Removed automatic seeding; new accounts start with no projects/pins. getProjects hides only the exact untouched legacy sample (fixed ID/name/description) from stored lists without deleting raw storage; customised copies and real projects are preserved. Existing project and chat-pin storage remains namespaced by authenticated user ID. AppLayout now renders its workspace under an account-ID key so switching accounts remounts routes and discards old in-memory projects/pins/pending chat results. Existing component export, routes and backend are preserved. Expanded userStorage regression coverage: scoped project pin/update/delete, empty new profiles, legacy sample filtering/customisation preservation and per-user chat pins. Full frontend suite: 114 passed (18 files); npm run build passed. Isolated browser test created/pinned browser-local projects under two existing users, pinned an existing chat, switched accounts, verified no cross-account items, restored the owner's pins on returning, and confirmed foreign project URLs unavailable in both directions. No test database records were created/deleted; only isolated browser storage changed (plus normal login timestamp). Harness: git-ignored scratch/check_account_isolation.txt. git diff --check passed and relevant diff reviewed. Existing logout/session-invalid behaviour still clears scoped browser storage; server persistence of projects/pins is outside this change. No blockers.

Sidebar logo size (2026-11-03): changed only the workspace header BrandLogo size prop from its 32px default to existing lg preset (40px); both light/dark logo variants enlarge together. Shared logo module and other pages unchanged. Added a sidebar regression for both image variants and retained collapse control. Verification result recorded below.
Sidebar logo verification: focused AppLayout tests 5 passed; git diff --check passed and size-prop diff reviewed. No browser screenshot check for this small preset-only change; no blockers.

Sidebar logo follow-up (2026-11-03): increased only the workspace BrandLogo prop from lg to existing xl preset (48px on small screens, 56px from md upward). Updated the existing both-theme logo size assertion. Focused AppLayout tests: 5 passed; git diff --check passed and size prop/assertion reviewed. Shared logo module unchanged; no blockers.

Chats dropdown (2026-11-03): added an initially open native details/summary section labelled Chats around date-grouped chat history and its empty state. Chevron, hover and keyboard-focus styles support both themes; pinned items, Projects and existing chat actions remain outside/unchanged. Added sidebar regression covering initial expansion, summary association and Projects outside the dropdown. Focused AppLayout tests: 6 passed; tsc -b passed. Isolated Chrome confirmed mouse collapse hides only history, Projects remains visible, Enter reopens with the same chats. The first keyboard harness omitted the native keypress text; the corrected full Enter event passed. git diff --check passed and relevant JSX/CSS diff reviewed. No blockers; dropdown state is local to the mounted workspace and starts open.

Chats dropdown return-state fix (2026-11-03): changed Chats to default collapsed. AccountWorkspace reads/writes chat_history_expanded under the existing per-user storage namespace; native toggle events update React state and save the choice. Returning from admin or refreshing no longer reopens a collapsed history. Explicitly expanded choices are also restored; storage failures retain functional in-memory toggling. Updated sidebar regressions: 8 passed; tsc -b passed. Isolated Chrome tested initial hidden state, click open/collapse, actual sidebar Admin Dashboard link and return link, preference restoration in both states, and collapsed reload. All passed. git diff --check passed and relevant JSX/state diff reviewed. No modules removed or backend changes; no blockers. Existing logout scoped-storage cleanup still applies.

Projects dropdown (2026-11-03): added an accessible Projects toggle and hidden list, initially collapsed, matching Chats styling. projects_expanded uses existing per-user storage and is independent of chat_history_expanded; choice survives admin navigation and reload. Create-project plus button remains visible outside the hidden list. Existing project actions, pinned section, routes and modules preserved. Added two sidebar regressions for collapsed default/create control placement and per-account independent saved state. Focused AppLayout tests 10 passed; tsc -b passed. Isolated Chrome confirmed mouse/Enter toggle, Chats independence, both saved states after actual admin roundtrip, collapsed reload, and opening/cancelling Create while collapsed. No database edits beyond ordinary login timestamp; the test project was isolated browser storage only. git diff --check passed and relevant JSX/CSS diff reviewed. No blockers.

Session summary requested (2026-11-03): created SESSION_CHANGES_2026-11-03.md at repository root, listing local UI/theme/profile-isolation work, startup/account/provider configuration without credentials, remote updates pulled, files changed and verification scopes. Distinguishes the earlier full 114-test run from the final focused 10 sidebar tests/TypeScript check; final dropdown production build was not rerun. Documentation-only change; no application tests rerun. No blockers.

Branch delivery preparation (2026-11-03): created updated_admin_dashboard from main 9dcae91 at the owner's explicit request to commit/push this session's changes. Final full frontend suite: 120 passed (18 files); npm run build passed (TypeScript plus Vite); git diff --check passed. Application/test/report and this session's engineering-memory edits are intended for the branch commit. Local .env.example edits contain credentials and remain unstaged, unchanged; active .env and scratch/browser artifacts stay ignored. Checked pending source/documentation additions against configured secret values without exposing them. SESSION_CHANGES_2026-11-03.md now reflects final verification and the delivery branch. Push follows commit; record any failure before ending.

Branch published (2026-11-03): implementation commit 8486313 successfully pushed to origin/updated_admin_dashboard; upstream tracking configured. Includes the complete local frontend changes, regression tests, engineering notes and session report. Final full suite 120 passed; production build passed. Credential-bearing owner .env.example edits remain local and unstaged; .env/scratch ignored. The original pre-pull stash remains available. This publication note/report update is a documentation-only follow-up commit. No unresolved blockers.
