## 1. What gets deployed

`docker-compose.prod.yml` runs three containers on one server:

```text
 Browser ──HTTPS──▶ web (Caddy, ports 80/443) ──▶ backend (FastAPI, :8000) ──▶ postgres (PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector)
                     ├─ serves the React app              ├─ runs DB migrations on start      └─ volume: pgdata
                     ├─ /api/* and /health → backend       └─ reads ./knowledge_base
                     └─ gets the HTTPS certificate (Let's Encrypt)
```

| Container | Built from | Published | Data kept in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | `frontend/Dockerfile` + `frontend/Caddyfile` | ports 80 and 443 | volumes `caddy_data`, `caddy_config` (certificates) |
| `backend` | `backend/Dockerfile` | no (only reachable through `web`) | bind mount `./knowledge_base` (source documents, admin uploads) |
| `postgres` | `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` | no | volume `pgdata` (users, chats, documents, embeddings) |

The browser only ever talks to `https://<your domain>`: the app is served at `/` and the API at `/api`, so no CORS or API address has to be configured.

## 2. What you need

| Item | Minimum | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux server (VM) | 2 vCPU, **4 GB RAM**, 30 GB disk | 8 GB RAM recommended. Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 is assumed below. The backend loads PyTorch and an embedding model (about 1.5 GB RAM). |
| Domain name | one host name, e.g. `assistant.example.com` | A DNS **A** record (and **AAAA** if the server has IPv6) pointing at the server's public IP. |
| Open ports | 22 (SSH), **80** and **443** (TCP), 443/UDP optional | Port 80 is needed for the Let's Encrypt certificate. |
| LLM API key | at least one | Groq is the default provider: <https://console.groq.com/keys>. Gemini and OpenRouter are fallbacks. |
| Tavily API key | optional | Web search fallback and SAP images: <https://app.tavily.com>. |

## 3. Prepare the server

SSH into the server, then:

```sh
# Docker Engine + Compose plugin (official convenience script)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"      # run docker without sudo; log out and back in afterwards

# Check (log in again first)
docker version
docker compose version               # must be v2.x

# Firewall (if ufw is enabled)
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443
```

On a cloud provider, also open ports 80 and 443 in the instance's security group / network firewall.

Check DNS before continuing; it must print the server's public IP:

```sh
getent hosts assistant.example.com
```

## 4. Get the code

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/clyptus && sudo chown "$USER": /opt/clyptus
git clone https://github.com/vamshiyadav-06/SAP_chatbot.git /opt/clyptus/app
cd /opt/clyptus/app
```

All later commands run in this folder.

The backend container runs as user id `1000` and saves admin-uploaded documents into `./knowledge_base`. Make sure that user id can write there:

```sh
id -u                                   # if this prints 1000, nothing to do
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 knowledge_base  # otherwise (or set APP_UID in .env to your id)
```

## 5. Create the `.env` file

```sh
cp .env.production.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Generate one random value for **each** secret below (run the command once per value):

```sh
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Open `.env` (`nano .env`) and set:

| Setting | What to put there |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_DOMAIN` | your host name without `https://`, e.g. `assistant.example.com` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | the same name with `https://`, e.g. `https://assistant.example.com` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | a new random value (database superuser) |
| `SAP_BRIM_DB_PASSWORD` | a new random value (application database user) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | replace `change-me-app-password` with the **same** value as `SAP_BRIM_DB_PASSWORD`; keep `@postgres:5432` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | a new random value (signs login tokens; at least 32 characters) |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | your admin login (password 12-72 characters) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` (and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) | at least one LLM key |
| `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Tavily key, optional |
| `APP_UID` | only if `id -u` was not `1000` |
| `REGISTRATION_ENABLED` | `True` shows the Register button (open sign-up, no e-mail verification: anyone can use your LLM quota); `False` hides it and you create users with `backend/scripts/create_user.py`. It is built into the web image, so rebuild after changing it. |

Everything else can stay as it is. Notes:

- `.env` sets `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml`, so the plain `docker compose ...` commands in this guide use the production stack. Run them from the repository folder.
- The database passwords are applied **only when the database volume is created** (first start). Changing them later in `.env` does not change the database; see [Rotate secrets](#rotate-secrets).
- The backend refuses to start in production with an empty or short `JWT_SECRET`, a `change-me` database or admin password, or a `localhost`/wildcard `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. The reason is printed in `docker compose logs backend`.
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL` must stay equal to the value used where the knowledge base was embedded (the template value matches the development template).

## 6. Start the stack

**If you will restore a backup in step 7 (option A), do that first and start the full stack afterwards.**

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build downloads Python packages, PyTorch (CPU), the embedding model and the OCR models, and builds the React app. It takes about 10-20 minutes; later builds reuse the cache.

Check that everything runs:

```sh
docker compose ps                       # postgres "healthy", backend "healthy" (after up to 2 minutes), web "running"
docker compose logs -f backend          # wait for "SAP BRIM AI backend ready to accept requests."  (Ctrl+C to stop following)
curl https://assistant.example.com/health
# {"status":"healthy","database":{"status":"connected"}}
```

What happens on first start:

1. `postgres` creates the `sap_brim_ai` role and database with the `vector` extension (`docker/postgres/init`).
2. `backend` applies all database migrations (`alembic upgrade head`), creates the super admin from `.env`, then starts the API.
3. `web` obtains the HTTPS certificate for `APP_DOMAIN` (watch `docker compose logs web` if the site does not open).

## 7. Load the knowledge base

A new database contains no documents, so Scholar mode has nothing to retrieve until you do **one** of the following.

### Option A (recommended): restore a backup of an existing installation

This copies everything: documents, embeddings, source tiers, users and chats, so nothing has to be re-embedded.

**On the existing machine** (for example the development PC, with its database container running), make a backup as the application role, which exists on every installation:

```sh
docker exec sap_assistant_postgres pg_dump -U sap_brim_ai -d sap_brim_ai -Fc -f /tmp/sap_brim_ai.dump
docker cp sap_assistant_postgres:/tmp/sap_brim_ai.dump ./sap_brim_ai.dump
scp ./sap_brim_ai.dump <user>@<server>:/opt/clyptus/
```

Also copy documents that were uploaded through the admin portal and are not in Git: copy the existing `knowledge_base/documents/` folder into `/opt/clyptus/app/knowledge_base/documents/` on the server (for example with `scp -r` or `rsync`).

**On the server**, before the first full start (fresh `pgdata` volume):

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres                                   # database only; wait until "healthy" in: docker compose ps
docker compose cp /opt/clyptus/sap_brim_ai.dump postgres:/tmp/sap_brim_ai.dump
docker compose exec postgres sh -c 'pg_restore -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d sap_brim_ai --no-owner --role=sap_brim_ai --no-comments --exit-on-error /tmp/sap_brim_ai.dump'
docker compose exec postgres rm /tmp/sap_brim_ai.dump
docker compose up -d --build                                    # backend migrates the restored data to the current version
```

`pg_restore` prints nothing when it succeeds. It must run against the empty database created on first start; if it reports that objects already exist, the database is not empty: stop and check before going further. Users and admins from the backup can sign in with their existing passwords; `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` only creates an admin if that e-mail does not exist yet.

### Option B: start empty and ingest the documents

1. Index every document in `knowledge_base/documents/` (PDF, TXT, MD); this is CPU-heavy and takes a while:

   ```sh
   docker compose exec backend python backend/app/ingestion/ingest.py
   ```

   Or upload files in the admin portal (**Document Manager & Ingestion**) and click **Process All Documents**.

2. Set each document's **source tier**. New documents start as `self_authored`, which retrieval skips (`INCLUDE_SELF_AUTHORED_DOCS=False`), so Scholar finds nothing until tiers are set. The admin UI has no tier control yet; use the API with an admin token:

   ```sh
   DOMAIN=https://assistant.example.com
   TOKEN=$(curl -s "$DOMAIN/api/auth/admin-login" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"email":"admin@your-company.com","password":"<admin password>"}' \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')

   # list documents (id, filename, tier)
   curl -s "$DOMAIN/api/documents?page_size=200" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

   # classify one document
   curl -s -X PATCH "$DOMAIN/api/documents/<document_id>/tier" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"source_tier":"official_sap"}'
   ```

   Tiers: `official_sap`, `sap_partner_or_book`, `official_sap_domain`, `forum`, `self_authored`, `github_repo`, `unknown`. `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` lists the project-generated documents that should stay `self_authored`.

## 8. Sign in and check the deployment

| Who | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Super admin | `https://<domain>/admin/login` |
| Individual users (sign up themselves) | `https://<domain>/login` |
| Organisation members | `https://<domain>/organisation/login` |

Smoke test after every deployment:

- [ ] `https://<domain>/health` returns `"healthy"`, and `http://<domain>` redirects to HTTPS.
- [ ] Admin login works, and the admin **Document Manager** lists the expected documents as processed.
- [ ] A **Sprint** question gets an answer that streams in word by word (if it arrives all at once at the end, see Troubleshooting).
- [ ] A **Scholar** question about a document in the knowledge base gets an answer.
- [ ] Sign-up, sign-in and sign-out work for a normal user.

The interactive API documentation (`/docs`) is switched off in production and is not forwarded by the web container.

## 9. Day-to-day operations

All commands run in `/opt/clyptus/app`.

### Status and logs

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f backend          # or: web, postgres
docker compose logs --since 1h backend
```

Container logs are rotated automatically (5 files of 10 MB per container).

### Update to a new version

Back up first (next section), then:

```sh
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps                       # backend becomes "healthy" again after the migrations ran
```

The backend applies new database migrations when it starts. If the backend does not come back, check `docker compose logs backend` before doing anything else.

### Roll back

If a new version misbehaves, go back to the previous commit. Migrations are additive, so older code runs on the newer schema; if a migration itself failed, restore the backup you took before updating.

```sh
git log --oneline -5                      # note the last good commit
git checkout <good-commit>
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Do not run `docker compose down -v` (it deletes the database volume).

### Backups

Back up the database daily and keep copies **off the server**. A manual backup:

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/clyptus/backups
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U sap_brim_ai -d sap_brim_ai -Fc > /opt/clyptus/backups/sap_brim_ai-$(date +%F-%H%M).dump
ls -lh /opt/clyptus/backups               # the file must not be empty
```

Daily at 02:00 with 14 days kept (`crontab -e`):

```cron
0 2 * * * cd /opt/clyptus/app && docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U sap_brim_ai -d sap_brim_ai -Fc > /opt/clyptus/backups/sap_brim_ai-$(date +\%F).dump && find /opt/clyptus/backups -name '*.dump' -mtime +14 -delete
```

Also back up `.env` (it holds the only copy of your secrets) and `knowledge_base/documents/` (admin uploads). The backups contain user data and chat history: store them encrypted and with restricted access.

**Restore** a backup: follow [Option A](#option-a-recommended-restore-a-backup-of-an-existing-installation) on a fresh database. To restore over a running installation, restore into a new database next to it first and check it, as described in [docker.md §8](docker.md#8-backup-and-restore). Never delete the `pgdata` volume (`docker compose down -v`) without a verified backup.

### Rotate secrets

**Keys that were committed to Git (`685bb31`, Clyptus-Soft history) must be rotated.** That commit put the Groq, Google Gemini and OpenRouter API keys into `.env.example`. Create a **new** key at each provider's console, put it in the server `.env`, then delete (revoke) the old key there. Never reuse a value from Git, chat or a template. The history was not rewritten; removing it from Clyptus-Soft needs a force-push that only the repository owner should decide.

- **`JWT_SECRET`:** change it in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d backend`. Every user is signed out.
- **LLM / Tavily keys:** change them in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d backend`.
- **Database application password:** the database keeps its own copy, so change both:

  ```sh
  NEW='<new random value>'
  docker compose exec postgres sh -c "psql -U \"\$POSTGRES_USER\" -d postgres -c \"ALTER ROLE sap_brim_ai PASSWORD '$NEW'\""
  # then set SAP_BRIM_DB_PASSWORD and the password inside DATABASE_URL in .env to the same value, and:
  docker compose up -d backend
  ```

- **Admin password:** `docker compose exec backend python backend/scripts/set_admin_password.py admin@your-company.com` (prompts for the new password).

### Restart and stop

```sh
docker compose restart backend          # e.g. after editing .env: use "docker compose up -d backend" instead, which reloads .env
docker compose stop                     # stop everything; data is kept
docker compose up -d                    # start again
```

### Capacity

The backend runs **one** worker process on purpose: rate limits, login lockout and the Stop button for answers that keep generating after the browser leaves are tracked inside that process (`KNOWN_ISSUES.md` STREAM-001). For more capacity, give the server more CPU and RAM. Running several workers or replicas first needs `REDIS_URL` (shared rate limits) and the STREAM-001 fix.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| `docker compose` complains `Set POSTGRES_PASSWORD in .env` / `Set APP_DOMAIN in .env` | `.env` is missing or the value is empty. Run commands from the repository folder; check `.env`. |
| `docker compose ps` lists only a `postgres` service named `sap_assistant_postgres` | `.env` does not set `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml`, so the development file was used. Add the line, or use `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ...`. |
| backend keeps restarting, log says `INSECURE CONFIGURATION` | Fix the setting named in the message (`JWT_SECRET`, a `change-me` password, `SUPER_ADMIN_*`), then `docker compose up -d backend`. |
| backend log: `Production requires explicit public ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<your domain>` (no localhost, no `*`). |
| backend log: `password authentication failed for user "sap_brim_ai"` | `DATABASE_URL` password differs from the one the database was created with. Use the original value, or change it in the database ([Rotate secrets](#rotate-secrets)). |
| The site does not open / certificate errors | `docker compose logs web`: DNS must point at this server and ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from the internet. Let's Encrypt limits retries; fix DNS/firewall first, then `docker compose restart web`. |
| `502 Bad Gateway` on `/api/...` | The backend is still starting (model loading, migrations) or has stopped: `docker compose ps`, `docker compose logs backend`. |
| API requests answer `{"detail":"HTTPS is required."}` | A request reached the backend without passing through `web`, or `TRUSTED_PROXIES` was overridden. Use the domain over HTTPS; do not publish the backend port. |
| Every answer says the assistant is unavailable | No working LLM key: check `GROQ_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and the backend log (`missing_api_key`, `auth_error`, `rate_limited`). |
| Scholar finds nothing although documents are processed | Source tiers are still `self_authored` ([Option B step 2](#option-b-start-empty-and-ingest-the-documents)), or `EMBEDDING_MODEL` differs from the one the vectors were made with (re-ingest or restore the matching value, then rebuild). |
| Admin upload fails with a permission error | `./knowledge_base` is not writable by `APP_UID` (default 1000): `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 knowledge_base`. |
| Answers appear only at the end instead of streaming | Something between the browser and the server buffers responses (a CDN or corporate proxy). Disable buffering for `/api/`; Caddy itself flushes immediately. |
| The build fails while installing packages | Retry `docker compose build --no-cache backend`; check free disk space (`df -h`, at least 10 GB free for the build). |

## 11. Other ways to host it

- **Behind an existing reverse proxy or load balancer that terminates HTTPS:** you can still use the images. Run `web` on an internal port (`HTTP_PORT=8080`, `APP_DOMAIN=:80`, and drop the 443 mappings), point your proxy at it, and make sure your proxy sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. Caddy forwards that header only from proxies it trusts: add a [`trusted_proxies`](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#trusted-proxies) global option with your proxy's address to `frontend/Caddyfile`, otherwise the backend answers `HTTPS is required`.
- **Frontend on a static host (CDN), API elsewhere:** build the frontend with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/api` (see `frontend/.env.example`), serve `frontend/dist/` with an `index.html` fallback for unknown paths, and add the frontend's origin to the backend's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- **Without Docker:** follow [SETUP.md §15](SETUP.md#15-deploying-to-a-server) (Python 3.12 virtual environment, `uvicorn` behind your own HTTPS proxy, PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector).

## 12. Go-live checklist

- [ ] All secrets in `.env` are new random values; no value from a template, chat or old commit is reused. Keys that were ever committed to Git are revoked (`HUMAN_ACTIONS.md`).
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<domain>`, `APP_DOMAIN=<domain>`.
- [ ] `.env` is `chmod 600` and backed up somewhere safe.
- [ ] The knowledge base is loaded and source tiers are set (Scholar answers from documents).
- [ ] A daily database backup runs, and one restore has been tested.
- [ ] Ports 80 and 443 are open; nothing else is published (PostgreSQL and the backend are internal).
- [ ] The smoke test in [section 8](#8-sign-in-and-check-the-deployment) passes.
- [ ] Owner decisions in `HUMAN_ACTIONS.md` (knowledge-base licensing, approved LLM providers) are settled.
